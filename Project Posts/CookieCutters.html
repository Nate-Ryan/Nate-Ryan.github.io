						<h2>About <strong>This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">The Engineering Student Council came to me with a really fun idea—creating cookie cutters shaped like our school mascot, Zippy the kangaroo. As part of the council, I was excited to get started on something that would bring a little extra school spirit to everyone, especially during finals week.</p>
					<p class="lead">I used some of the same skills from my previous projects, like importing SVG files into SolidWorks. This was especially helpful since cookie cutters are mostly just outlines, so converting the Zippy logo into a vector file saved a lot of time. After importing, it was mostly straightforward modeling work to get the design just right.</p>
					<p class="lead">One new thing I had to figure out was how to make the cookie cutters food-safe. 3D-printed parts can have health risks if they’re not properly coated, so I dipped the cutters in a food-safe epoxy resin. This gave them a smooth finish, though they still aren’t ideal for long-term or repeated use, and definitely not dishwasher-safe.</p>
					<p class="lead">In the end, it was great to contribute to a project that would brighten up finals week. Seeing students smile when they got their cookie cutters made it all worth it!</p>
