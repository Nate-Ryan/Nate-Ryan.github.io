						<h2>About <strong> This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">The need for this project came about when my brother's antenna cover to his car broke off during winter. During winter break I decided to model a replacement for his car rather than spending upwards of $70 dollars on a manufacteured one, especially when it is normally an injection molded part.</p>
					<div>
						<p class="lead">I began by taking measurements of the fitting connected to the roof as I did not have the physical cover to measure. Many refrence photos online were used to supplement the design process. After the intial measurements for the fitting it was trial and error until my model resembeld that of refrence photos. </p>
						<div>
							<p class="lead">The third model I printed out fit like a glove, and in my opinion is indistinguishable by the eye from the real part. I applied a two part eppoxy to the model and fitting on the roof and it has held in place since.</p>
						</div>
                        <div>
                            <p class="lead">A project like this is what gave me a passion for engineering, CAD, and 3d printing. To be able to solve real problems in daily life while saving money in the long run is an awesome ability to have. I may not have learned anything new from this project, but I was able to practice and further the skills I already had. Not to mention how much fun I had along the journey.</p>
