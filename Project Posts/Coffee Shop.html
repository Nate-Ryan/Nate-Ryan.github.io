						<h2>About <strong>This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">This is one of the first projects I completed in Blender, and it was a really exciting challenge for me. Inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TzjpR3pdpk" target="_blank">Polygon Runway's Tutorial</a>, I wanted to create a coffee shop scene on my own. The tutorial gave me a good starting point, but I was determined to figure out the rest—especially the materials, lighting, and camera work.</p>
					<p class="lead">One of the toughest parts was getting the lighting just right. I played around with different light positions, strengths, and colors to create the atmosphere I had in mind. After a lot of trial and error, I feel like I learned a lot about how to set the mood using Blender’s tools, and that was pretty exciting for me as a beginner!</p>
					<p class="lead">Overall, this project was a big confidence boost. It helped me get more comfortable with Blender, and I’m excited to keep pushing myself with more ambitious projects in the future!</p>
