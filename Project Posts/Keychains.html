						<h2>About <strong> This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">Engineering student council came to me with a new project. They wanted to make cookie cutters for our school logo "Zippy" a kangaroo.</p>
					<div>
						<p class="lead">To acomplish this project I implemented skills I gained from my poker chip models, that being the use of svg drawings. I converted a logo of zippy into a vector file and then imported the drawing into Solidworks. This was the bulk of the work considering cookie cutters are mostly an outline for the modeling side of things.</p>
						<div>
							<p class="lead">The added step which was new for me was epoxy dipping all of the parts in a food safe resin. There are many health dangers in 3d printed parts when not completely covered / made correctly. Even still they are not the best for long repeteated use and will typically not be dish washer safe.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p class="lead">I was happy to be able to meet the need of an organization that I am apart of, and provide a product that was sure to put a smile on many students face as they were handed out during finals week.</p>
