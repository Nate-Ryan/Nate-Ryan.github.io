						<h2>About <strong> This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">The poker chips have been a very fun side project that will continue for the forseeable future. With my previous experience on and around high school golf teams I was able to identify a need for fundraising materials. From this I developed the idea to make custom poker chips to be used as "ball markers" for golf or as a sovenier piece to sell.</p>
						<div>
							<p class="lead">I learned a lot of new strategies while modeling in solidworks. One being the implementation of using svg / vector files to import drawings. I used this to import high school logos, allowing me to model the complex logos without measuring and modeling by hand. This workflow saves a lot of time and effort and is definetly a tool I will remember.</p>
						</div>
                    <div>   <p class="lead"> The intent of modeling these parts was for commercial use. I was able to network and market with golf coaches from Ohio, and have recieved amazing feedback on the product. I am currently in the process of scaling this side project into a small business as these chips provide returning customers. </p>
