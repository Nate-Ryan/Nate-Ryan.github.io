						<h2>About <strong>This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">The Engineering Student Council at my school reached out to me, asking if I could help create graduation cord charms for their students. Since I'm part of the program myself, I was really excited to contribute and get to work!</p>
					<p class="lead">This project was also my first time 3D modeling with the goal of using multiple materials and parts in one design. I had just purchased a Bambu Labs AMS system, which lets me use up to 4 materials in one print. Learning how to model parts to minimize color bleed, reduce print time, and save material was a big learning curve, but it was totally worth it.</p>
					<p class="lead">To make the cord charms, I modeled the ESC logo by tracing over a reference photo. Later on, I learned how to extract the logo into an SVG file, which would have saved me a lot of time! But modeling it the long way gave me a better understanding of how things work, so it wasnâ€™t time wasted at all.</p>
					<p class="lead">After making the charms, I decided to reuse the ESC logo for some souvenir tokens for the leadership team. One side had the logo, and the other side displayed their role and the year they served. I think they turned out pretty cool!</p>
					<p class="lead">I was really happy to complete this project for an organization that has given me so much. Plus, I learned a lot about multi-material manufacturing and modeling for real-world use. Definitely a rewarding experience!</p>
