						<h2>About <strong> This Project</strong></h2>
					</div>
					<p class="lead">The Engineering Student Council from my school approached me and asked if I could make graduation cord charms for their students. Being apart of the the program myself I was excited to help and get started.</p>
					<div>
						<p class="lead">>This project was also my first chance to learn 3d modeling with the intention of using multiple materials or integrated parts. I recently purchased a bambu labs ams system, allowing me to splice up to 4 materials into one print. Learning how to model parts to reduce color bleed, decreasing print time and material waste was a learning curve.</p>
						<div>
							<p class="lead">I created a model of the ESC logo by drawing over a reference photo, later on I learned a new tool to extract the logo into an svg file to save time. However at this point I learned the long way to model this project which gave me a better appreciation for svg files later.</p>
						</div>
                        <div>
                            <p class="lead">After making the cord charms I decided to re-use the logo to make sovenier tokens for the leadership team of ESC. One side had the logo and the other side had the position held and the year held.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p class="lead">I was very happy to complete this project for an organization that has provided me with so many opportunities, meanwhile learning valuable skills regarding modeling parts with the intent of multi-material manufacturing.</p>
